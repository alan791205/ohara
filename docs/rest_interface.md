# Ohara REST Interface

ohara provides a bunch of REST APIs of managing data, applications and cluster for ohara users.
Both request and response must have application/json content type, hence you should set content type to application/json in your request.
    
    Content-Type: application/json
    
and add content type of the response via the HTTP Accept header:

    Accept: application/json

----------
## object id
Most storable objects in ohara is assigned with a unique id. Most access to objects require the id to indicate which
object you want to request. You don't need to worry about how to generate the unique id but you need to **remember**
the id in order to operate the object. Or you can request **list** to see all objects and then fetch the id to to other
operation like delete and update.

----------
## Statuses & Errors

ohara leverages akka-http to support standards-compliant HTTP statuses. your clients should check the
HTTP status before parsing response entities. The error message in response body are format to json content.

```json
{
  "code": "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException",
  "message": "Unsupported restful api:vasdasd. Or the request is invalid to the vasdasd",
  "stack": "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported restful api:vasdasd. Or the request is invalid to the vasdasd at"
}
```
    
1. code (**string**) — the type of error. It is normally a type of java exception
1. message (**string**) — a brief description of error
1. stack (**string**) — error stack captured by server
----------
## Manage clusters

You are tired to host a bunch of clusters when you just want to build a pure streaming application. So do we!
Ohara aims to take over the heavy management and simplify your life. Ohara leverage the docker technology to run all process
in containers. If you are able to use k8s, ohara is good at deploying all containers via k8s. If you are too afraid to touch k8s,
Ohara is doable to be based on ssh connection to control all containers.

Ohara automatically configure all clusters for you. Of course, you have the freedom to overwrite any settings.
see section [zookeeper](#zookeeper), [broker](#broker) and [worker](#worker) to see more details.

In order to provide a great experience in exercising containers, ohara pre-builds a lot of docker images with custom
scripts. Of course, Ohara APIs allow you to choose other image instead of ohara official images. However, it works only if
the images you pick up are compatible to ohara command. see [here](https://github.com/oharastream/ohara/tree/master/docker) for more details.
Also, all official images are hosted by [docker hub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/oharastream/repository/list)

----------
## Version

We all love to see the version of software, right? Ohara provide a API to display the details of version. It includes
following information.

1. version (**string**) — version of configurator
1. user(**string**) — builder of configurator
1. revision(**string**) — latest commit of configurator
1. date(**string**) — build date of configurator

----------
### get the version of ohara

*GET /v0/info*

**Example Response**

```json
{
  "versionInfo": {
    "version": "0.3-SNAPSHOT",
    "user": "Chia-Ping Tsai",
    "revision": "9af9578041f069a9a452c7fda5f7ed7217c0deea",
    "date": "2019-03-21 17:55:06"
  }
}
```
----------
## Topic

Ohara topic is based on kafka topic. It means the creation of topic on ohara will invoke a creation of kafka also.
Also, the delete to ohara topic also invoke a delete request to kafka. The common properties in topic are shown below.

1. [id](#object-id) (**string**) — topic id
1. name (**string**) — topic name
1. brokerClusterName (**string**) — the broker cluster hosting this topic
1. numberOfReplications (**int**) — the number of replications for this topic
1. numberOfPartitions (**int**) — the number of partitions for this topic
1. lastModified (**long**) — the last time to update this topic

> Most properties are mapped to kafka. A little magic, but, is that ohara uses [id](#object-id) rather than "name" in naming kafka topic.
The reason is that kafka disallows us to change topic name after creation, and ohara UI (ohara-manager) supports user
to change "topic name" at runtime. Hence, we use a id instead of name specified by user to set kafka topic, and process
the name (passed from user) as a "label".

----------
### create a topic

*POST /v0/topics*

1. name (**string**) — topic name
1. brokerClusterName (optional **string**) — the broker cluster hosting this topic

And it works only if there is only a broker cluster exists in ohara**)
1. numberOfReplications (optional **int**) — the number of replications for this topic
(**it is illegal to input the number of replications which is larger than the number of broker nodes**)
1. numberOfPartitions (optional **int**)— the number of partitions for this topic

## JDBC Connection Information

Database is a common data source in our world. Ohara also supports to link database to be a part of streaming, so there
are also APIs which help us to store related information used to connect database. Given that we are in java world,
the jdbc is only supported now. The storable information is shown below.

1. name (**string**) — name of this jdbc information.
1. url (**string**) — jdbc connection information. format: jdbc:${database}://${serverName}\$instanceName:$portNumber
1. user (**string**) — the account which has permission to access database
1. password (**string**) — password of account. It is stored as text in ohara

## Connector

Connector is core of application in ohara [pipeline](#pipeline). Connector has two type - source and sink. Source connector
pulls data from another system and then push to topic. By contrast, Sink connector pulls data from topic and then push to
another system. In order to use connector in [pipeline](#pipeline), you have to set up a connector settings in ohara and then add it
to [pipeline](#pipeline). Of course, the connector settings must belong to a existent connector in target worker cluster. By default,
worker cluster hosts only the official connectors. If you have more custom requirement for connector, please follow
[custom connector guideline](custom_connector.md) to write your connector. 

Apart from custom settings, common settings are required by all connectors. The common settings are shown below.
1. connector.name (**string**) — the name of this connector
1. connector.class (**class**) — class name of connector implementation
1. topics(**array(string)**) — the source topics or target topics for this connector
1. columns (**array(object)**) — the schema of data for this connector
  - columns[i].name (**string**) — origin name of column
  - columns[i].newName (**string**) — new name of column
  - columns[i].dataType (**string**) — the type used to convert data
  - columns[i].order (**int**) — the order of this column
1. numberOfTasks (**int**) — the number of tasks
1. workerClusterName (**string**) — target worker cluster

The following information are updated by ohara.
1. [id](#object-id) (**string**) — connector's id
1. lastModified (**long**) — the last time to update this connector
1. state (**optional(string)**) — the state of a started connector. If the connector is not started, you won't see this field
1. error (**optional(string)**) — the error message from a failed connector. If the connector is fine or un-started, you won't get this field.
1. [metrics](custom_connector.md#metrics) (**object**) — the metrics from a running connector
  - meters (**array(object)**) — the metrics in meter type
    - meters[i].value (**double**) — the number stored in meter
    - meters[i].unit (**string**) — unit for value
    - meters[i].document (**string**) — document of this meter
    
The settings from request, BTW, is a individual item in response. Hence, you will observe the following response
after you store the settings with connector.class.

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "connector.class": "abc"
  }
}

```
----------
### create the settings of connector

*POST /v0/connectors*

It is ok to lack some common settings when creating settings for a connector. However, it is illegal to start a connector
with incomplete settings. For example, storing the settings consisting of only **connector.name** is ok. But stating
a connector with above incomplete settings will introduce a error.

**Example Request**

```json
{
  "connector.name": "jdbc_name",
  "connector.class": "com.island.ohara.connector.ftp.FtpSource"
}
```

**Example Response**

```json
{

      "meters": []
    }
  }
]
```
----------
### delete a connector

*DELETE /v0/connectors/${id}*

Deleting the settings used by a running connector is not allowed. You should [stop](#stop-a-connector) connector before deleting it.

**Example Response**

```json
{

----------
### get information of connector

*GET /v0/connectors/${id}*

**Example Response**

  },
  "metrics": {
    "meters": []
  }
}
```
----------
### start a connector

*PUT /v0/connectors/${id}/start*

Ohara will send a start request to specific worker cluster to start the connector with stored settings, and then make
a response to called. The connector is executed async so the connector may be still in starting after you retrieve
the response. You can send [GET request](#get-information-of-connector) to see the state of connector.
This request is idempotent so it is safe to retry this command repeatedly.

**Example Response**

```json
{

### stop a connector

*PUT /v0/connectors/${id}/stop*

Ohara will send a stop request to specific worker cluster to stop the connector. The stopped connector will be removed from
worker cluster. The settings of connector is still kept by ohara so you can start the connector with same settings again
in the future. If you want to delete the connector totally, you should stop the connector and then [delete](#delete-a-connector) it.
This request is idempotent so it is safe to send this request repeatedly.

**Example Response**

```json
{
  "lastModified": 1540967970407,
  "id": "9d128f43-8725-42b2-9377-0dad10863166",
  "settings": {
    "connector.name": "jdbc_name",
    "connector.class": "com.island.ohara.connector.ftp.FtpSource"
  },
  "metrics": {
    "meters": []
  }
}
```
----------
### pause a connector

*PUT /v0/connectors/${id}/pause*

Pausing a connector is to disable connector to pull/push data from/to source/sink. The connector is still alive in kafka.
This request is idempotent so it is safe to send this request repeatedly.

**Example Response**

```json
{
  "lastModified": 1540967970407,
  "id": "9d128f43-8725-42b2-9377-0dad10863166",

        "value": 1234,
        "unit": "rows",
        "document": "number of processed rows"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
----------
### resume a connector

*PUT /v0/connectors/${id}/resume*

Resuming a connector is to enable connector to pull/push data from/to source/sink.
This request is idempotent so it is safe to retry this command repeatedly.

**Example Response**

```json
{
  "lastModified": 1540967970407,
  "id": "9d128f43-8725-42b2-9377-0dad10863166",

      {
        "value": 1234,

        "document": "number of processed rows"
      }
    ]
  }
}

## Pipeline

Pipeline APIs are born of ohara-manager which needs a way to store the relationship of components in streaming.
The relationship in pipeline is made up of multi **flows**. Each **flow** describe a **from** and multi **to**s.
For example, you have a [topic](#topic) as source and a [connector](#connector) as consumer, so you can describe the relationship
via following flow.
```json
{
  "flows": [
    {
      "from": "topic's id",
      "to": ["connector's id"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Each object described in pipeline must be related to a existent object. If you delete a object which is already used by
a pipeline, it will be deleted from pipeline's flow.

All objects in pipeline MUST work on the same cluster hierarchy. For example, you have following clusters.
1. a ([worker cluster](#worker)) based on
1. b ([broker cluster](#broker)) based on
1. c ([zookeeper cluster](#zookeeper))

When you add a [topic](#topic) to pipeline which is located at cluster-a, the [topic](#topic) must be located at broker-b. Otherwise, you will get
a error saying the [topic](#topic) can't be belong to you. A [connect](#connector) which is not hosted by same worker cluster
can't be related to pipeline also.

The properties used in generating pipeline are shown below.
1. name (**string**) — pipeline's name
1. flows (**array(object)**) — the relationship between objects
  - flows[i].from (**string**) — the endpoint of source
  - flows[i].to (**array(string)**) — the endpoint of sink
1. workerClusterName (**string**) — target worker cluster
  
Following information are written by ohara.
 1. [id](#object-id) (**string**) — pipeline's id
 1. lastModified (**long**) — the last time to update this pipeline
 1. objects(**array(object)**) — the abstract of all objects mentioned by pipeline
   - objects[i].[id](#object-id) (**string**) — object's id
   - objects[i].name (**string**) — object's name
   - objects[i].kind (**string**) — the type of this object. for instance, [topic](#topic), [connector](#connector), and [streamapp](#streamapp) 
   - objects[i].className (**string**) — object's implementation. Normally, it shows the full name of a java class
   - objects[i].state (**optional(string)**) — the state of object. If the object can't have state (eg, [topic](#topic)), you won't see this field
   - objects[i].error (**optional(string)**) — the error message of this object
   - objects[i].lastModified (**long**) — the last time to update this object
   - [metrics](custom_connector.md#metrics) (**object**) — the metrics from this object. Not all objects in pipeline have metrics!
     - meters (**array(object)**) — the metrics in meter type
       - meters[i].value (**double**) — the number stored in meter
       - meters[i].unit (**string**) — unit for value
       - meters[i].document (**string**) — document of this meter
----------
### create a pipeline

*POST /v0/pipelines*

The following example creates a pipeline with a [topic](#topic) and [connector](#connector). The [topic](#topic) is created on
[broker cluster](#broker) but the [connector](#connector) isn't. Hence, the response from server shows that it fails
to find the status of the [connector](#connector). That is to say, it is ok to add un-running [connector](#connector) to pipeline.

**Example Request 1**

```json
{

    }
  ]
}

### list all pipelines

*GET /v0/pipelines*

Listing all pipelines is a expensive operation as it invokes a iteration to all objects stored in pipeline. The loop will
do a lot of checks and fetch status, metrics and log from backend clusters. If you have the id of pipeline, please
use [GET](#get-a-pipeline) to fetch details of **single** pipeline.

## Node

Node is the basic unit of running service. It can be either physical machine or vm. In section [Zookeeper](#zookeeper),
[Broker](#broker) and [Worker](#worker), you will see many requests demanding you to fill the node name to build the
services. Currently, ohara requires the node added to ohara should pre-install following services.
1. docker (18.09+)
1. ssh server
1. k8s (only if you want to k8s to host containers)
1. official ohara images
  - [oharastream/zookeeper](https://cloud.docker.com/u/oharastream/repository/docker/oharastream/zookeeper)
  - [oharastream/broker](https://cloud.docker.com/u/oharastream/repository/docker/oharastream/broker)
  - [oharastream/connect-worker](https://cloud.docker.com/u/oharastream/repository/docker/oharastream/connect-worker)
  - [oharastream/streamapp](https://cloud.docker.com/u/oharastream/repository/docker/oharastream/streamapp)

The version (tag) depends on which ohara you used. It would be better to use the same version to ohara. For example,
the version of ohara configurator you are running is 0.4, then the official images you should download is oharastream/xx:0.4.

The properties used in describing a node are shown below.
1. name (**string**) — hostname of node
1. port (**int**) — ssh port of node
1. user (**string**) — ssh account
1. password (**string**) — ssh password

> ohara use above information to login node to manage the containers. Please make sure the account has permission to
operate docker (and k8s service) without sudo.

The following information are tagged by ohara.
1. [id](#object-id) (**string**) — node id
1. lastModified (**long**) — the last time to update this node

## Zookeeper

[Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org) service is the base of all other services. It is also the fist service you should
set up. At the beginning, you can deploy zookeeper cluster in single node. However, it may be unstable since single node
can't guarantee the data durability when node crash. In production you should set up zookeeper cluster on 3 nodes at least.

Zookeeper service has many configs which make you spend a lot of time to read and set. Ohara provides default values to
all configs but open a room to enable you to overwrite somethings you do care.
1. name (**string**) — cluster name
1. imageName (**string**) — docker image
1. clientPort (**int**) — broker client port.
1. electionPort (**int**) — used to select the zk node leader
1. peerPort (**int**) — port used by internal communication
1. nodeNames (**array(string)**) — the nodes running the zookeeper process

## Broker

[Broker](https://kafka.apache.org/intro) is core of data transmission in ohara. The topic, which is a part our data lake,
is hosted by broker cluster. The number of brokers impacts the performance of transferring data and data durability.
But it is ok to setup broker cluster in single node when testing. As with [Zookeeper](#zookeeper), broker has many configs also.
Ohara still provide default to most configs and then enable user to overwrite them.

Broker is based on [Zookeeper](#zookeeper), hence you have to create zookeeper cluster first. Noted that a zookeeper
cluster can be used by only a broker cluster. It will fail if you try to multi broker cluster on same zookeeper cluster. 

The properties which can be set by user are shown below.
1. name (**string**) — cluster name
1. imageName (**string**) — docker image
1. clientPort (**int**) — broker client port
1. exporterPort (**int**) — port used by internal communication
1. jmxPort (**int**) — port used by jmx service
1. zookeeperClusterName (**String**) — name of zookeeper cluster used to store metadata of broker cluster
1. nodeNames (**array(string)**) — the nodes running the broker process
----------

### delete a broker cluster

*DELETE /v0/brokers/$name*

It is disallowed to remove a broker cluster used by a running [worker cluster](#worker).

**Query Parameters**
1. force (**boolean**) — true if you don't want to wait the graceful shutdown (it can save your time but may damage your data). Other values invoke graceful delete. 

**Example Response**

```json
{
  "name": "bk00",

----------
### add a new node to a running broker cluster

*POST /v0/brokers/$name/$nodeName*

If you want to extend a running broker cluster, you can add a node to share the heavy loading of a running broker cluster.
However, the balance is not triggered at once.

**Example Response**

```json
{
  "name": "bk00",
  "zookeeperClusterName": "zk00",
  "imageName": "oharastream/broker:0.4-SNAPSHOT",
  "exporterPort": 7071,
  "clientPort": 9092,
  "jmxPort": 9093,
  "nodeNames": [
    "node01",
    "node00"
  ]
}
```
----------
### remove a node from a running broker cluster

*DELETE /v0/brokers/$name/$nodeName*

If your budget is limited, you can decrease the number of nodes running broker cluster. BUT, removing a node from a
running broker cluster invoke a lot of data move. The loading may burn out the remaining nodes.

**Example Response**

```json
{
  "name": "bk00",
  "zookeeperClusterName": "zk00",
  "imageName": "oharastream/broker:0.4-SNAPSHOT",
  "exporterPort": 7071,
  "clientPort": 9092,

  "nodeNames": [
    "node00"
  ]
}
```
----------
## Worker

[Worker](https://kafka.apache.org/intro) is core of running connectors for ohara. It provides a simple but powerful system
to distribute and execute connectors on different nodes. The performance of connectors depends on the scale of worker cluster.
For example, you can assign the number of task when creating connector. If there is only 3 nodes within your worker cluster and
you specify 6 tasks for your connector, the tasks of you connectors still be deployed on 3 nodes. That is to say, the connector
can't get more resources to execute.

Worker is based on [Broker](#broker), hence you have to create broker cluster first. Noted that a broker
cluster can be used by multi worker clusters. BTW, worker cluster will pre-allocate a lot of topics on broker cluster, and
the pre-created topics CAN'T be reused by different worker clusters.

The properties which can be set by user are shown below.
1. name (**string**) — cluster name
1. imageName (**string**) — docker image
1. clientPort (**int**) — worker client port.
1. jmxPort (**int**) — worker jmx port.
1. brokerClusterName (**string**) — broker cluster used to host topics for this worker cluster
1. jars (**array(string)**) — the id of jars that will be loaded by worker cluster. You can require worker cluster to
                              load the jars stored in ohara if you want to run custom connectors on the worker cluster.
                              see [Jars APIs](#jars) for uploading jars to ohara.  
1. nodeNames (**array(string)**) — the nodes running the worker process
1. configTopicName (**string**) — a internal topic used to store connector configuration
1. configTopicReplications (**int**) — number of replications for config topic
1. configTopicPartitions (**int**) — number of partitions for config topic
1. offsetTopicName (**string**) — a internal topic used to store connector offset
1. offsetTopicReplications (**int**) — number of replications for offset topic
1. offsetTopicPartitions (**int**) — number of partitions for offset topic
1. statusTopicName (**string**) — a internal topic used to store connector status
1. statusTopicReplications (**int**) — number of replications for status topic
1. statusTopicPartitions (**int**) — number of partitions for status topic
1. groupId (**string**) — the id of worker stored in broker cluster
1. nodeNames (**array(string)**) — the nodes running the worker process

> The groupId, configTopicName, offsetTopicName and statusTopicName must be unique in broker cluster. Don't reuse them
in same broker cluster. Dispatching above unique resources to two worker cluster will pollute the data. Of course,
ohara do a quick failure for this dumb case. However, it is not a quick failure when you are using raw kafka rather than
ohara. Please double check what you configure!

After building the worker cluster, ohara starts to fetch the details of available connectors from the worker cluster.
The details is the setting definitions of connector. It shows how to assign the settings to a connector correctly.
The details of connector's setting definitions can be retrieved via [GET](#get-a-worker-cluster) or [LIST](#list-all-workers-clusters),
and the JSON representation is shown below.
```json
{
  "connectors": [
    {
      "className": "xxx",
      "definitions": [
        {
          "reference": "NONE",
          "displayName": "connector.class",
          "internal": false,
          "documentation": "the class name of connector",
          "valueType": "CLASS",
          "tableKeys": [],
          "orderInGroup": 0,
          "key": "connector.class",
          "required": true,
          "defaultValue": null,
          "group": "core",
          "editable": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
1. connectors (**array(string)**) — the available connectors of  worker cluster
  - connectors[i].className (**string**) — the class name of available connector
  - connectors[i].definitions (**array(object)**) — the settings used by this connector
    - connectors[i].definitions[j].displayName (**string**) — the readable name of this setting
    - connectors[i].definitions[j].group (**string**) — the group of this setting (all core setting are in core group)
    - connectors[i].definitions[j].orderInGroup (**int**) — the order in group
    - connectors[i].definitions[j].editable (**boolean**) — true if this setting is modifiable 
    - connectors[i].definitions[j].key (**string**) — the key of configuration
    - connectors[i].definitions[j].[valueType](#setting-type) (**string**) — the type of value
    - connectors[i].definitions[j].defaultValue (**string**) — the default value
    - connectors[i].definitions[j].documentation (**string**) — the explanation of this definition
    - connectors[i].definitions[j].[reference](#setting-reference) (**string**) — works for ohara manager. It represents the reference of value.
    - connectors[i].definitions[j].required(**boolean**) — true if this setting has no default value and you have to assign a value. Otherwise, you can’t start connector.
    - connectors[i].definitions[j].internal (**string**) — true if this setting is assigned by system automatically.
    - connectors[i].definitions[j].tableKeys (**array(string)**) — the column name when the type is TABLE

Apart from official settings (topics, columns, etc), a connector also have custom settings. Those setting definition can
be found through [GET](#get-a-worker-cluster) or [LIST](#list-all-workers-clusters). And for another, the worker cluster needs
to take some time to load available connectors. If you don't see the setting definitions, please retry it later. 

----------
### Setting Type

The type of value includes two processes to input value when you are trying to run a connector. For example, starting
a connector will fail when you input a string to a setting having **int** type. The acceptable types are shown below.
1. Boolean — the value must be castable to **java.lang.Boolean**
1. String — the value must be castable to **java.lang.String**
1. Short — the value must be castable to **java.lang.Short**
1. Int — the value must be castable to **java.lang.Integer**
1. Long — the value must be castable to **java.lang.Long**
1. Double — the value must be castable to **java.lang.Double**
1. Class — the value must be castable to **java.lang.String** and it must be equal to a class in worker's jvm
1. Password — the value must be castable to **java.lang.String**. the value is replaced by **hidden** in APIs
1. List — the value must be castable to **java.lang.String** and it is split according to JSON array
1. Table — the value must be castable to **java.lang.String** and it has the following JSON representation.
1. Duration — the value must be castable to **java.time.Duration** and it is based on the ISO-8601 duration format PnDTnHnMn.nS
```json
[
  {
    "order": 1,
    "c0": "v0",
    "c1": "v1",
    "c2": "v2"
  },
  {
    "order": 2,
    "c0": "t0",
    "c1": "t1",
    "c2": "t2"
  }
]
```
How to get the description of above **keys**? If the setting type is **table**, the setting must have **tableKeys**. It
is a array of string which shows the keys used in the table type. For instance, a setting having table type is shown below.
```json
{
  "reference": "NONE",
  "displayName": "columns",
  "internal": false,
  "documentation": "output schema",
  "valueType": "TABLE",
  "tableKeys": [
    "order",
    "dataType",
    "name",
    "newName"
  ],
  "orderInGroup": 6,
  "key": "columns",
  "required": false,
  "defaultValue": null,
  "group": "core",
  "editable": true
}
```

### add a new node to a running worker cluster

*POST /v0/workers/$name/$nodeName*

If you want to extend a running worker cluster, you can add a node to share the heavy loading of a running worker cluster.
However, the balance is not triggered at once. By the way, moving a task to another idle node needs to **stop** task
first. Don't worry about the temporary lower throughput when balancer is running.

**Example Response**

```json
{
  "statusTopicName": "status-89eaef1e9d",
  "name": "wk00",
  "offsetTopicPartitions": 1,
  "brokerClusterName": "preCreatedBkCluster",
  "connectors": [],

  ]
}
```
----------
### remove a node from a running worker cluster

*DELETE /v0/workers/$name/$nodeName*

If your budget is limited, you can decrease the number of nodes running worker cluster. BUT, removing a node from a
running worker cluster invoke a lot of task move, and it will decrease the throughput of your connector.

**Example Response**

```json
{
  "statusTopicName": "status-89eaef1e9d",
  "name": "wk00",
  "offsetTopicPartitions": 1,
  "brokerClusterName": "preCreatedBkCluster",
  "connectors": [],

## Validation

Notwithstanding we have read a lot of document and guideline, there is a chance to input incorrect request or settings
when operating ohara. Hence, ohara provides a serial APIs used to validate request/settings before you do use them
to start service. Noted that not all request/settings are validated by Ohara configurator. If the request/settings is
used by other system (for example, kafka), ohara automatically bypass the validation request to target system and then
wrap the result to JSON representation.

----------
### Validate the FTP connection

*PUT /v0/validate/ftp*

The parameters of request are shown below.
1. hostname (**string**) — ftp server hostname
1. port (**int**) — ftp server port
1. user (**string**) — account of ftp server
1. password (**string**) — password of ftp server
1. workerClusterName (**string**) — the target cluster used to validate this connection

**Example Request**

```json
{
  "hostname": "node00",
  "port": 22,
  "user": "user",
  "password": "pwd"
}
```

> Ohara picks up the single worker cluster directly when you ignore the element of worker cluster.

Since FTP connection is used by ftp connector only, ohara configurator involves several connectors to test the connection properties.
Ohara configurator collects report from each connectors and then generate a JSON response shown below.
1. hostname (**string**) — the node which execute this validation
1. message (**string**) — the description about this validation
1. pass (**boolean**) — true is pass

**Example Request**

```json
[
  {
    "hostname": "node00",
    "message": "succeed to connector to ftp server",
    "pass": true
  }
]
```
----------

    "pass": true
  }
]
```
----------
### Validate the HDFS connection

*PUT /v0/validate/hdfs*

The parameters of request are shown below.
1. uri (**string**) — hdfs url
1. workerClusterName (**string**) — the target cluster used to validate this connection

**Example Request**

```json
{
  "uri": "file://"
}
```

> Ohara picks up the single worker cluster directly when you ignore the element of worker cluster.

{
  "name": "node00",
  "port": 22,
  "user": "abc",
  "password": "pwd"
}
```

Since Node connection is used by ohara configurator only, ohara configurator validates the connection by itself.
The format of report is same to other reports but the **hostname** is fill with **node's hostname** rather than node which
execute the validation.
1. hostname (**string**) — node's hostname
1. message (**string**) — the description about this validation
1. pass (**boolean**) — true is pass

**Example Response**

```json
[
  {
    "hostname": "node00",
    "message": "succeed to connector to ssh server",
    "pass": true
  }
]
```
----------
### Validate the connector settings

*PUT /v0/validate/connector*

Before starting a connector, you can send the settings to test whether all settings are available for specific connector.
Ohara is not in charge of settings validation. Connector MUST define its setting via [setting definitions](custom_connector.md#setting-definitions).
Ohara configurator only repackage the request to kafka format and then collect the validation result from kafka.

**Example Request**

The request format is same as [connector request](#create-the-settings-of-connector)

**Example Response**

If target connector has defined the settings correctly, kafka is doable to validate each setting of request. Ohara configurator
collect the result and then generate the following report.

```json
{
  "errorCount": 0,
  "settings": [
    {
      "definition": {
        "reference": "NONE",
        "displayName": "connector.class",
        "internal": false,
        "documentation": "the class name of connector",
        "valueType": "CLASS",
        "tableKeys": [],
        "orderInGroup": 0,
        "key": "connector.class",
        "required": true,
        "defaultValue": null,
        "group": "core",
        "editable": true
      },
      "setting": {
        "key": "connector.class",
        "value": "com.island.ohara.connector.perf",
        "errors": []
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The above example only show a part of report. The element **definition** is equal to [connector's setting definition](#worker).
The definition is what connector must define. If you don't write any definitions for you connector, the validation will do nothing
for you. The element **setting** is what you request to validate.
1. key (**string**) — the property key. It is equal to key in **definition**
1. value (**string**) — the value you request to validate
1. errors (**array(string)**) — error message when the input value is illegal to connector 
----------
## Container

Each processes managed by ohara is based on docker container. In most cases, user don't need to know the details of containers
since the management of containers is on ohara's shoulder. However, ohara understand that we all have curious brain so ohara
supports to display the container's details of a running cluster. Noted that the context may be changed between different
release of ohara. And the distinct implementations of container manager possibly provide different context of containers.

----------
### retrieve the container details of a running cluster

*GET /v0/containers/$clusterName*

**Example Response**

The **cluster name** may be mapped to different services (of course, it would be better to avoid using same name on different services),
hence, the returned JSON is in array type. The details of elements are shown below.
1. clusterName (**string**) — cluster name
1. clusterType (**string**) —  cluster type
1. containers (**array(object)**) — the container in this cluster

## StreamApp

Ohara StreamApp is a unparalleled wrap of kafka streaming. It leverages and enhances [kafka streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) to make developer
easily design and implement the streaming application. More details of developing streaming application is in [custom stream guideline](custom_streamapp.md).

Assume that you have completed a streaming application via ohara Java APIs, and you have generated a jar including your streaming code.
By Ohara Restful APIs, you are enable to control, deploy, and monitor your streaming application.
As with cluster APIs, ohara leverages docker container to host streaming application. Of course, you can apply your favor  
container management tool including simple (based on ssh) and k8s when you are starting ohara.

Before stating to use restful APIs, please ensure that all nodes have downloaded the [StreamApp image](https://cloud.docker.com/u/oharastream/repository/docker/oharastream/streamapp).
The jar you uploaded to run streaming application will be included in the image and then executes as a docker container.
The [StreamApp image](https://cloud.docker.com/u/oharastream/repository/docker/oharastream/streamapp) is kept in each node so don't worry about the network. We all hate re-download everything when running services.

The following information of StreamApp are updated by ohara.
1. workerClusterName (**string**) — worker cluster name this streamApp belong to
1. id (**string**) — unique id of this streamApp
1. name (**string**) — custom name of this streamApp
1. instances ( **int**) — numbers of streamApp container
1. jarInfo (**object**) — uploaded jar information
1. from (**array(string)**) — topics of streamApp consume with
1. to (**array(string)**) — topics of streamApp produce to
1. state (**option(string)**) — only started/failed streamApp has state
1. error (**option(string)**) — the error message from a failed streamApp. If the streamApp is fine or un-started, you won't get this field.
1. lastModified (**long**) — last modified this jar time

## Jars

Ohara encourages user to write custom application if the official applications can satisfy requirements for your use case.
Jar APIs is a useful entry of putting your jar on ohara and then start related services with it. For example, [Worker APIs](#create-a-worker-cluster)
accept a **jars** element which can carry the jar id pointing to a existent jar in ohara. The worker cluster will load all
connectors of the input jar, and then you are able to use the connectors on the worker cluster.

The properties stored by ohara are shown below.
1. id (**string**) — the jar id
1. name (**string**) — the file name
1. size (**long**) — file size
1. lastModified (**long**) — the time of uploading this file

----------

### upload a jar to ohara

*POST /v0/jars*

**Example Request**

```http request
Content-Disposition: form-data
filename="aa.jar"
```

You have to specify the file name since it is a part of metadata stored by ohara.

**Example Response**
```json
{
  "id": "aaa",
  "name": "aa.jar",
  "size": 12345,
  "lastModified": 7777
}
```

----------

### list all jars

*GET /v0/jars*

**Example Response**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "aaa",
    "name": "aa.jar",
    "size": 12345,
    "lastModified": 7777
  }
]
```
----------

### delete a jar

*DELETE /v0/jars/$id*

**Example Response**
```json
{
  "id": "aaa",
  "name": "aa.jar",
  "size": 12345,
  "lastModified": 7777
}
```

> If you delete a jar is used by other services, you also break the scalability of service as you can't run the jar
  on any new nodes
  
----------

### get a jar

*GET /v0/jars/$id*

**Example Response**
```json
{
  "id": "aaa",
  "name": "aa.jar",
  "size": 12345,
  "lastModified": 7777
}
```
----------

### download a jar

*GET /v0/downloadJars/$id*

> This API is used by internally, and you should not have interest in downloading jar. However, human begins are so complicated.
  At any rate, ohara open this door to advanced user but noted that this API is not in ohara standard format.
----------
## Logs

This world is beautiful but not safe. Even though ohara shoulders the blame for simplifying your life, there is a
slim chance that something don't work well in ohara. The Logs APIs, which are engineers' best friend, open a door
to observe the logs of running cluster.

It collect output from all containers' of a cluster and then format them to JSON representation which has following elements.
1. name (**string**) — cluster name
1. logs (**array(object)**) — log of each container
  - logs[i].name — container's name
  - logs[i].value — total output of a container
 
----------
### get the log of a running cluster

*GET /v0/logs/$clusterType/$clusterName*

- clusterType (**string**)
  - zookeepers
  - brokers
  - workers

**Example Response**

```json
{
  "name": "precreatezkcluster",
  "logs": [
    {
      "name": "node00",
      "value": "2019-04-15 02:13:33,168 [myid:] - INFO [main:QuorumPeerConfig@136"
    }
  ]
}
